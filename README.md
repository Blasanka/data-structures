## Content:

## 1. Stack

- Provide Last In First Out(LIFO)
- Lastly added value will remove first.
- Example: When you press few keys on keyboard they are adding to a stack and when you press delete key lastly added value will remove first.

## 2. Queue (Linear Queue and Circular Queue)

- Provide First In First Out(FIFO)
- Firstly added value will remove first.
- Example: This is like a persons in a queue to get meds or something in real life, firstly came person will get meds first.

## 2. LinkedList

- Linked objects. Just like a simple class and properties/variables with a special property called --next to hold another Link/object memory address(In Java actually we don't have memory address rather we have hash code(example: #342ff3) for every object to uniquely identify that object.).
